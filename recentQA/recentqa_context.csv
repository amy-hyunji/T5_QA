"Country music icon Kenny Rogers, known for hits like “Islands in the Stream” and “The Gambler,” has died from natural causes. He was 81. His family confirmed his death on Friday on Twitter. ""The Rogers family is sad to announce that Kenny Rogers passed away last night at 10:25PM at the age of 81,"" the tweet read. ""Rogers passed away peacefully at home from natural causes under the care of hospice and surrounded by his family."" Announcing his retirement in 2015, Rogers had been touring the globe over the past few years on The Gambler’s Last Deal, a farewell tour named after his 1979 song “The Gambler.” He had cut the tour short in April, however, citing “a series of health challenges.”
“His doctors fully expect the outcome to be great, but they have advised him to cancel all performances through the end of the year to focus on recuperation,” Rogers’ reps said in a statement at the time.
Over the course of Rogers’ illustrious career, he received three Grammys, a place in the Country Music Hall of Fame, and 18 American Music Awards -- a pretty impressive resumé for someone who always said, “I've never felt I was a particularly good singer, but I've always thought I had a great knack for picking hit songs.”
His first hit song was ""That Crazy Feeling"" in the 1950s, a song that landed him an appearance on American Bandstand. He played jazz as a member of The Bobby Doyle Three, but then joined the folk group The New Christy Minstrels as a singer and double-bass player in 1966. Rogers and fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams, and Thelma Camacho eventually left that group to form The First Edition.
The spotlight started sticking more to Rogers as the group was renamed Kenny Rogers and the First Edition and they scored a hit with “Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In).” Rogers launched his solo career after the group disbanded in 1976.
“Lucille,” off his self-titled second album, solidified Rogers’ career and earned him a Grammy. The track was named both Song of the Year and Single of the Year by the Academy of Country Music.
“The Gambler,” the title track off his sixth studio album, came in 1978 and became so popular it served as the inspiration for a television movie (and four sequels) with Rogers starring as Brady Hawkes. This marked another creative facet to Rogers, who worked as an actor and photographer alongside music.
1983 was the year he and Dolly Parton became the definition of perfect duet partners with “Islands in the Stream,” which they followed with hits like “Love Is Strange"" and ""You Can't Make Old Friends.”
“I take great pride in that we have a very warm, sweet friendship that we’ve had for 30 years,” Rogers recalled to PEOPLE in a 2017 interview. “It all started when [singer-songwriter] Barry Gibb wrote ‘Islands in the Stream,’ and he gave it to me to record -- he was producing an album.”
Singing it “for four days,” Rogers came to the conclusion that he didn’t really like what would become a future hit -- which is why he made a recommendation. “We need Dolly Parton,'” he recalled saying. “I had a recording studio at the time and she was downstairs and my manager Ken Kragen said, ‘I just saw her!’ and I said, ‘Well, go get her!’ He went downstairs and she came marching into the room, and once she came in and started singing, the song was never the same. It took on a personality of its own.”
Rogers continued reaching new heights at the age of 61 when he became the oldest artist to reach the No. 1 spot on the country music charts with “Buy Me a Rose” in 2000. By 2012, he became a New York Times best-selling author with the release of Luck or Something Like It -- A Memoir. By 2013, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Country Music Association.
Rogers had been singing that line from “The Gambler,” “you've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em” for years. In 2015, he decided he needed to fold ‘em. On his decision to retire, he told Savannah Guthrie and Carson Daly on the Today show, “I’ve done this long enough. I wrote in my book that sometimes there’s a fine line between being driven and being selfish, and I think I crossed that line when I was younger. I really want to be there with my kids and my wife. They’re very important to me and I don’t see enough of them.”
Stars from across the country music scene -- including Reba McEntire, Chris Stapleton, and Lady Antebellum -- gathered for a tribute concert in Nashville to give Rogers a grand send-off. Reunited with Parton, they performed “You Can’t Make Old Friends” and, of course, “Island in the Stream” for the audience, while the “Joelene” singer offered a rendition of “I Will Always Love You” to her longtime friend.
“We’ve been so excited about this because he says, of course, he’s retiring,” Parton said. “Kenny, I just wanted to say that I’m really, really proud of you, and I just hope many, many years from now when I’m older, I’ll know when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em.”
Rogers is survived by wife Wanda and five children — daughter Carole, sons Christopher and Kenny, and twins Jordan and Justin." "Rishi Sunak was appointed appointed Chancellor to replace Sajid Javid last month after Mr Javid refused to continue under the conditions imposed by Number 10. The PM’s team wanted more control over the spending plans, something Mr Javid was not prepared to budge on, meaning he had no choice but to resign. The shock turn of events meant that his number two, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Mr Sunak, took over as chancellor – stepping into the role just a month before delivering the Spring Budget on Wednesday 11 March.  It is a remarkable rise for Mr Sunak who has only been an MP since 2015.
Background Mr Sunak, 39, the son of a doctor and pharmacist, was born and grew up in Southampton, Hampshire. Also like many of his political colleagues, he went on to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Oxford University. After graduating he completed an MBA from Stanford University.
It was at Stanford that he met his wife, Akshata Murthy – the daughter of billionaire Narayana Murthy. The couple married in 2009 and have two daughters. Before entering politics he went into banking – working as an analyst for Goldman Sachs and then becoming a hedge-fun manager and later partner. Mr Sunak also became a director of investment firm Catamaran Ventures – a firm owned his father-in-law. Political career Mr Sunak was selected as the Conservative candidate for Richmond (in North Yorkshre) in 2014 after former party leader William Hague announced he was stepping down as MP. He was elected into the seat in 2015 with a majority of 19,550 (36.2 per cent) – about 5,000 votes fewer than his predecessor. Ukip candidate Matthew Cooke came second. He was re-elected in 2017, with an increased majority of 23,108 (40.5 per cent). The MP, a member of the environmental committee, has been an ardent supporter of Brexit and backed Leave in 2016 referendum campaign. He voted for former prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, but backed Mr Johnson to be the new leader after she announced she was stepping down. After becoming Prime Minister Mr Johnson appointed him as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He also became a member of the Privy Council the next day. In the build up to the 2019 general election, Mr Sunak replaced the Prime Minister in a seven-way televised leaders’ debate on ITV. He was named the new Chancellor of the Exchequer in the cabinet reshuffle of 13 February 2020 following Mr Javid’s shock resignation." "Roger Federer has landed the top spot on the annual Forbes list of the highest-paid athletes for the first time this year with $106.3 million in pre-tax earnings. The Swiss ace is the first tennis player to take the No. 1 rank since the list debuted in 1990.
Federer’s haul includes $6.3 million in prize money and $100 million from endorsements and appearance fees, lifting him from the No. 5 spot he held in 2019 and beating his previous high of second place in 2013.
“His brand is pristine,” says David Carter, a sports business professor at USC’s Marshall School of Business, “which is why those that can afford to align with him clamor to do so.”
Federer’s endorsement portfolio is unmatched among active athletes, with 13 brands including Barilla, Moet & Chandon and Rimowa paying between $3 million and $30 million to associate themselves with the 20-time Grand Slam champ. The 38-year-old and golfer Tiger Woods are the only two active athletes to have hit $100 million in a single year from sponsorships alone. Federer’s on-court résumé is the stuff of legend, with the men’s records for most Slam titles and most weeks ranked No. 1 (310). The consistency is staggering. He ranked in the top three for 750 straight weeks—almost 15 years—and qualified for 18 out of 19 Slam finals between 2005 and 2010.
Call it the Jordan playbook, the blueprint for global domination chronicled in ESPN’s ten-part documentary on the basketball great, The Last Dance: command a sport with a global audience for years; appeal to both men and women; stay out of trouble; add in a dose of swagger and a dash of charisma. It made Michael Jordan the richest athlete on the planet and the first billionaire athlete. Even in retirement, he continues to collect endorsement checks rivaling those of Federer and Woods thanks to his massive cut of Nike Jordan Brand sneaker sales. The three breathe a rarefied air, reserved for the most elite competitors. Jordan had the No. 1 spot on the Forbes list six times during his 13-year career with the Chicago Bulls, eventually giving up the mantle to Woods after he retired from the Bulls in 1998. (Formula One’s Michael Schumacher held the crown for two years between Woods and Jordan.) Woods went on to collect more than $100 million annually off the course at his peak, landing at the top of Forbes’ highest-paid athlete ranking a record 12 times until he broke stride, landing in hot water over an infidelity scandal while injuries contributed to a decade-long majors title drought on the links.
Federer, while seizing the top spot late in his career, is showing no signs of slowing down. His latest partnership is with Swiss startup running shoe On, whose headquarters sit close to the new home the tennis star is building on Lake Zurich. A renowned sneakerhead, Federer will endorse the brand, whose sales have been doubling annually since its 2010 launch, and also invested in the company in return for an equity stake that one source called “significant,” a partnership that could have serious upside for Federer. Another sign of his command of the off-court side hustle: Once companies align themselves with him, they almost never leave. Rolex, Credit Suisse, Mercedes-Benz and Wilson have all been on Team Fed for more than a decade. The exception? Jordan’s Nike.
Federer stunned the tennis world in 2018 when he split from the sneaker giant after 20 years and joined with apparel brand Uniqlo. The chain, part of Fast Retailing, made an offer he couldn’t turn down, promising $300 million over ten years whether he was playing tennis or not and leaving open a slot for a shoe deal like the one with On since the Japanese giant doesn’t make sneakers.
The length and terms of the deal raised eyebrows given that Federer was about to turn 37 when he signed it. At that age, almost all tennis players have long since retired—a detail that meant little to the long game the retailer is eyeing.
“We feel the greatest impact of Roger Federer is yet to come,” says Uniqlo’s head of global creative John Jay. “Of course, it will be fueled by his status as the greatest of all time, but Roger’s ability to bring positive change to the world is his future and ours.”
The company hopes Federer can hold the same kind of appeal Jordan still has long after he launched his last jump shot. Already, tennis clubs in Europe are flooded with kids wearing “RF” hats, the logo that Nike controlled for two years after the split but is back in Federer’s hands and is the foundation for future licensing deals.
It wasn’t his only shrewd move. Federer took more control of his brand when he left the IMG sports firm with longtime agent Tony Godsick to launch their own operation in 2013, dubbed TEAM8. Current clients include male tennis pros Juan Martin del Potro and Alexander Zverev, 16-year-old rising star Coco Gauff and New York Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist. TEAM8 also found success with the creation of a new annual event, the Laver Cup, which matches a team from Europe versus the rest of the world in a competition that is comparable to golf’s Ryder Cup.
Federer has other levers in the sport that even Jordan doesn’t have. He is a hot commodity for organizers of smaller tournaments that pay appearance fees for top players to show up; a men’s event without one of the Big Three—Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic—is a tough sell. Federer commands the top rate of more than $1 million per stop. Then there are the exhibition tours—a mix of tennis and show business—in places that have no major event to offer. He did a five-stop swing through Latin America in November that added more than $15 million to his bank account, including a match versus Zverev in a bullfighting stadium in Mexico City that attracted 42,517 fans, a record to watch a tennis match.
Federer has used his platform and cash to focus on educating children in Africa, with his namesake foundation spending $52 million to aid 1.5 million kids. He’s teamed with Bill Gates in charity matches three times; the latest “Match for Africa” featured Gates and Federer versus Nadal and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah in South Africa, where Federer’s mother was born. The February event raised $3.7 million.
Federer is the GOAT, both on and off the court." "On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, after a convenience store clerk claimed he used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.
Mr. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin, one of the police officers, handcuffed him and pinned him to the ground with a knee, an episode that was captured on video. Mr. Floyd’s death set off a series of nationwide protests against police brutality. Mr. Chauvin was fired from the Minneapolis police force, along with three other officers. He has been charged with both second- and third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. He now faces trial. Opening statements are scheduled for March 29."
"US basketball legend Kobe Bryant has died in a helicopter crash in California, sparking an outpouring of grief from fans around the world. Bryant, 41, and his daughter Gianna, 13, were among the nine killed when the aircraft came down in Calabasas. There were no survivors from Sunday's crash which happened in foggy weather. Bryant, a five-time NBA champion, played for the LA Lakers throughout his career and is considered one of the greatest players in the game's history. Tributes from celebrities, politicians and fellow sports stars have been pouring in, many expressing shock at his sudden death. Moments of silence have been observed at basketball games across the US."
"US kills Iran general Qassem Suleimani in strike ordered by Trump. Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that killed Iran’s most powerful general in the early hours of Friday, in a dramatic escalation of an already bloody struggle between Washington and Tehran for influence across the region.
Qassem Suleimani was hit by the drone strike while local allies from the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) drove him from Baghdad airport. The de facto leader of the PMF, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a close Suleimani associate, was also killed in the attack.
“General Suleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” a Pentagon statement said. “This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.”
Minutes before the announcement, Trump tweeted a US flag without comment. Later, the White House put out a statement saying the strike was a “decisive defensive action” carried out “at the direction of the president”. "
"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have announced they will step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. In a statement, Prince Harry and Meghan also said they plan to split their time between the UK and North America. The BBC understands no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consulted before the statement and Buckingham Palace is ""disappointed"". Senior royals are understood to be ""hurt"" by the announcement. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghan publicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight. In their unexpected statement on Wednesday, also posted on their Instagram page, the couple said they made the decision ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"".
""We intend to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen.""" "Durham Police have investigated Dominic Cummings' relocation of his family to Durham during lockdown. They found that when he subsequently drove to Barnard Castle to check his eyesight ""there might have been a minor breach"" of the law.
Mr Cummings has maintained he behaved reasonably and legally throughout the episode. 1. Why did Dominic Cummings drive his family 25 miles to Barnard Castle? Mr Cummings drove his family to Durham to stay at his father's farm on the evening of 27 March, after his wife fell ill and suspecting that he might soon fall ill. The next day he developed coronavirus symptoms and was self-isolating.
By 12 April Mr Cummings was cleared to return to work and wanted to travel back to London. He decided to go for a drive first to see whether he could drive safely. ""My wife was very worried particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.""
He explained that after parking on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town, he felt sick and the family walked ""about 10-15m"" and sat by the riverbank for about 15 minutes." "Tiger King: Zoo made famous by Netflix documentary about 'Joe Exotic' closes down - but it will become film set. The big cat zoo made famous by the hit Netflix documentary series Tiger King has closed its doors to the public.
The Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma had previously been owned by the star of the show, Joseph Maldonado-Passage - also known as Joe Exotic - who is serving a 22-year jail sentence for his role in a murder-for-hire plot. The current owner, Jeff Lowe, made the announcement on the park's Facebook hitting out at animal rights charity PETA who he says have made ""false accusations"" against him.
Earlier this year, the zoo was handed to Big Cat Rescue owner Carol Baskin after a judge ruled that Joe Exotic had fraudulently transferred ownership to his mother." "Early cases of COVID-19 were linked to a meat market in Wuhan, China, but investigations have not found samples of the coronavirus in carcasses. The World Health Organization (WHO) has released its plan to investigate the origins of the COVID pandemic. The search will start in Wuhan — the Chinese city where the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first identified — and expand across China and beyond. Tracing the virus’s path is important for preventing future viral spillovers, but scientists say the WHO team faces a daunting task.
Most researchers think the virus originated in bats, but how it jumped to people is unknown. Other coronaviruses have passed from an intermediate animal host; for example, the virus that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–04 probably came to people from raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) or civets.
“Finding an animal with a SARS-CoV-2 infection is like looking for a needle in the world’s largest haystack. They may never find a ‘smoking bat’” or other animal, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York City. “It will be key for the investigators to establish a collaborative relationship with scientists and government officials in China.”
Nailing down the origins of a virus can take years, if it can be done at all, and the investigation will also have to navigate the highly sensitive political situation between China and the United States. US President Donald Trump has been “calling it a China virus and the Chinese government is trying to do everything to prove that it is not a China virus”, says Linfa Wang, a virologist at Duke–National University of Singapore Medical School. The political blame game has meant that crucial details about research under way in China have not been made public, says Wang, who was part of the WHO mission that looked for the origin of SARS in China in 2003.
He hopes the situation with the new US administration will be less volatile. President-elect Joe Biden has also said he will reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the WHO. Support from China and the United States will create “a much more positive environment to conduct research in this field”, says Wang."
"Harvey Weinstein jailed for 23 years in rape trial. Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault. He was found guilty in a trial in New York last month, a dramatic fall from grace for one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The 67-year-old appeared in court on Wednesday in a wheelchair. His lawyers had appealed for leniency, saying even the minimum sentence of five years could be a ""life sentence"".
But prosecutors argued Weinstein should be given the maximum possible sentence given his ""lifetime of abuse"" towards women and ""lack of remorse"" for his actions. Weinstein addressed the court for the first time on Wednesday, saying he had ""deep remorse"" but described him and other men as ""totally confused"" by events in comments seen as critical to the #MeToo movement. Dozens of women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Weinstein since October 2017.
He has consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers have vowed to appeal against his conviction. These were the first charges to make it to trial. Weinstein still faces further criminal charges, for rape and sexual assault, in Los Angeles, where officials have started extradition proceedings.
Hours after being sentenced, he was taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan with chest pains, a spokesman said. He had heart surgery after his conviction." "SpaceX becomes first private company to launch humans into orbit.  Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX launched four astronauts on a flight to the International Space Station on Sunday, NASA’s first full-fledged mission sending a crew into orbit aboard a privately owned spacecraft.
SpaceX’s newly designed Crew Dragon capsule, which the crew has dubbed Resilience, lifted off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 7:27 p.m. eastern time (0027 GMT on Monday) from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
“That was one heck of a ride,” astronaut Mike Hopkins said from Crew Dragon to SpaceX mission control about an hour after liftoff. “There was a lot of smiles.” Crew Dragon will gradually raise its orbit for the next 27 hours through a series of onboard thruster firings, giving the astronauts time to eat pre-packaged dinners and roughly eight hours to rest before docking at the International Space Station at 11 p.m. eastern time on Monday.
An air leak caused an unexpected drop in capsule pressure less than two hours before launch, NASA officials said. But technicians said they conducted a successful leak check, and the scheduled launch was still on."
"Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized political and social movement protesting against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against black people.[1][2][3][4][5] While there are specific organizations such as the Black Lives Matter Global Network that label themselves simply as ""Black Lives Matter"", the Black Lives Matter movement comprises a broad array of people and organizations. The slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" itself remains untrademarked by any group.[6] The broader movement and its related organizations typically advocate against police violence toward black people as well as for various other policy changes considered to be related to black liberation.[7]
In July 2013, the movement began with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin 17 months earlier in February 2012. The movement became nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans, that of Michael Brown—resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a city near St. Louis—and Eric Garner in New York City.[8][9] Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election.[10] The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016.[11] The overall Black Lives Matter movement is a decentralized network of activists with no formal hierarchy.[12]
The movement returned to national headlines and gained further international attention[13] during the global George Floyd protests in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. An estimated 15 million to 26 million people participated in the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, making it one of the largest movements in the country's history.[14] The movement comprises many views and a broad array of demands but they center on criminal justice reform.
The popularity of Black Lives Matter has rapidly shifted over time. Whereas public opinion on Black Lives Matter was net negative in 2018, it grew increasingly popular through 2019 and 2020.[15] A June 2020 Pew Research Center poll found that 67% of adult Americans expressed some support for the Black Lives Matter movement.[16] A later poll conducted in September 2020 showed that support among American adults had dropped to 55%, with notable declines among whites and Hispanics, while support remained widespread among black adults.[17]"
"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds name baby son Wilfred. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds have named their son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, in a tribute to their grandfathers and the doctors who treated the prime minister for coronavirus.
Symonds, 32, posted a picture of her holding the newborn on Instagram on Saturday, saying she “couldn’t be happier” and that her “heart is full”. Symonds and Wilfred are understood to be back in Downing Street with Johnson.
The couple announced on Wednesday that she had given birth to a baby boy earlier that day. It came just weeks after Johnson was discharged from intensive care where he had been receiving treatment for Covid-19. Symonds also experienced symptoms of the disease.
She wrote in her Instagram post: “Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am. “Wilfred after Boris’s grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart – the two doctors that saved Boris’s life last month.

My heart is full.”" "Kanye West, a rapper, announced his 2020 United States presidential election campaign through Twitter on July 4, 2020, Independence Day. On July 16, 2020, the campaign filed a Statement of Candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. He entered the election after missing at least six states' deadlines to appear on the ballot as a third-party candidate.[6] West selected Michelle Tidball, a Christian preacher from Wyoming, as his running mate.
West's platform advocated for the creation of a culture of life, endorsing environmental stewardship, supporting the arts, buttressing faith-based organizations, restoring school prayer, and providing for a strong national defense.[7] A supporter of a consistent life ethic (a tenet of Christian democracy), West opposed abortion and capital punishment.[8]
West qualified for ballot access in 12 states.[9][10] The campaign sued for ballot access in five additional states (Arizona, Ohio, Wisconsin, Virginia and West Virginia), and subsequently lost all appeals, gave up on four other states (Illinois, Montana, Missouri, and New Jersey), and missed the deadlines of a further 29 states, plus the District of Columbia.[9] West additionally appeared on the California ballot, as Rocky De La Fuente's running mate, under the American Independent Party, something to which neither had consented.[11] Despite appearing on the California ballot as running mate, West urged his followers on Twitter to vote for him as a write-in instead.
West suspended his campaign on November 4, 2020, the morning after Election Day, after receiving over 60,000 votes in the 12 states where he had ballot access. West ultimately ranked 4th (5th in Minnesota and Colorado) in vote count in his states, and received the 5th highest national vote count for a non-perennial presidential ticket.[12][13] West expressed interest in running again in 2024 on the same day.[12][13][14]"
"Comedian Bill Bailey’s ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ win brings welcome sparkle to H&F. Bill Bailey’s triumph on Strictly Come Dancing means that the 2020 glitterball trophy will be sparkling on his Hammersmith mantelpiece on Christmas Day.
The comedian and musician danced his way to victory with partner Oti Mabuse, becoming the oldest celebrity to win the popular BBC television show last weekend. “It feels surreal, it feels extraordinary, it feels wonderful,” he said as presenter Tess Daly declared them the winners, and the Strictly dancefloor disappeared under a blizzard of tickertape. “I never thought we’d get this far, I never thought we’d get to the final.”
The couple performed their showdance to Queen’s ‘The Show Must Go On’. The comedian was not one of the favourites when the competition began but his dancing skills steadily improved as the competition went on, with the routine that he and Oti, 30, devised for the Sugarhill Gang’s ‘Rapper’s Delight’ winning him an army of fans.
Cllr Andrew Jones, H&F Cabinet Member for the Economy said: “We were willing him on in the final, and it’s a great feather in Hammersmith’s cap that Bill – who does so much for the arts locally – has been crowned this year’s Strictly champion.”
The 2020 Strictly series has been credited with lifting the nation’s mood during spells of lockdown with more than 13 million people watching the final." "The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.[a] The Democratic Party ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U.S. senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence.[6] Trump became the first U.S. president since George H. W. Bush in 1992 and the eleventh incumbent president in the country's history to lose a bid for a second term. Biden's 51.3% of the popular vote was also the largest percentage of the popular vote won by any challenger to an incumbent president since 1932.[7][8][9] The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since 1900,[10] with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008. Biden received more than 81 million votes,[11] the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[12] Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history.[13][14][15]
Biden secured the Democratic nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, in a competitive primary that featured the largest field of candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics. Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris from California, became the first African-American, first Asian-American, and third female[c] vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate. Central issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; civil unrest in reaction to the killing of George Floyd and others; the U.S. Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett; and the future of the Affordable Care Act.[16][17][18]
The election saw a record number of ballots cast early and by mail due to the ongoing pandemic.[19] Many more Democrats voted by mail compared to Republicans.[20] As a result of a large number of mail-in ballots, some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting; this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the president-elect and vice president-elect until the morning of November 7, three and a half days after the election. Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high mathematical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state.[21]
Before, during, and after Election Day, Trump and numerous Republicans attempted to subvert the election and overturn the results, alleging widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote counting process in swing states.[22][23][24] Attorney General William Barr and officials in each of the 50 states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election.[25][26] The Trump campaign and its allies, including Republican members of Congress,[27] continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing 63 lawsuits in several states with all but one minor case (which was later overturned) being withdrawn or dismissed by various courts,[28][29][30] spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud,[31] pressuring Republican state electors and legislators,[32] objecting to the Electoral College certification in Congress,[33][34] inciting insurrection at the United States Capitol,[35] and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition of Joe Biden in what was widely described as an attempted coup.[36] Trump stated that he would never concede the election.[37][38][39] On January 7, 2021, one day after the violent storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters and two months after Biden's victory was declared, Trump acknowledged the incoming administration without mentioning Biden's name in a video posted to Twitter.[40][41][42]
The election results in each state and the District of Columbia were certified by December 9.[43] The presidential electors formally cast their votes for president and vice president on December 14,[44][45] and their votes were officially counted by Congress on January 6–7, 2021, before and after pro-Trump insurrectionists stormed the Capitol.[46][47] Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021."
"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has said he acted reasonably and legally after driving 260 miles from his home to Durham during lockdown. 23 March: The prime minister tells the UK public they ""must stay at home"". People are warned not to meet friends or family members they do not live with. Those with symptoms had already been told to self-isolate.
27 March: Mr Cummings is seen leaving 10 Downing Street. ""I suddenly got a call from my wife who was looking after our four-year-old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill."" He went home, but after a couple of hours his wife felt better and he returned to work.
Guidance: If Mr Cummings believed his wife may have had coronavirus, the guidance was that ""all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days"".
What are social distancing and self-isolation rules? Evening: Mr Cummings went on to explain - ""That evening I returned home and discussed the situation with my wife. She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever."" Mr Cummings said many people he worked closely with, including the PM, had had symptoms or were absent with symptoms. He said: ""I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease.""
Later: Mr Cummings drove up to Durham with his family, arriving ""at roughly midnight"". ""I was worried that if my wife and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid.
""My wife had felt on the edge of being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier."" Mr Cummings did not say that at the point the family drove north his wife was unable to look after their child.
Guidance: Stay at home is the simple government advice for households where one or more members have coronavirus symptoms. However, the main advice page says it is not always straightforward when children are involved. It says: ""If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.""
Other government advice did not contain this caveat, such as the leaflet drawn up at the end of March to be sent to every house. Nor did the government page on essential travel which said: ""Essential travel does not include visits to second homes... whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence.""
Durham Police said on 28 May that it did not consider that going to Durham had been an offence. The police statement stressed that it was concerned with whether Mr Cummings had breached the regulations, not the general government guidance to ""stay at home""."

"‘Parasite’ becomes first non-English language film to win best picture Oscar. Subtitle this: “Parasite” is the first non-English language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.
Bong Joon Ho’s masterfully devious class satire took Hollywood’s top prize at the Oscars on Sunday night, along with awards for best director, best international film and best screenplay. In a year dominated by period epics — “1917,” “Once Upon a Time … In Hollywood,” “The Irishman” — the film academy instead went overseas, to South Korea, to reward a contemporary and unsettling portrait of social inequality in “Parasite.”
True to its name, “Parasite” simply got under the skin of Oscar voters, attaching itself to the American awards season and, ultimately, to history. The win was a watershed moment for the Academy Awards, which has long been content to relegate international films to their own category.
Multiple standing ovations greeted Bong’s several wins. “I am ready to drink tonight,” Bong said, prompting roars from the crowd. Unexpectedly called up again for best director, Bong saluted his fellow nominees, particularly Martin Scorsese, and concluded: “Now I’m ready to drink until tomorrow.” "
